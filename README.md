# Fashion centric Outfit Progression for dressing

## Requirements

- python 3.6.13
- torch 1.1.0 (as no third party libraries are required in this codebase, other versions should work, not yet tested)
- torchvision 0.3.0
- tensorboardX
- opencv



To run this project open Google Colab Notebook from here [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KDDCX5WSRYOBF0MfD6Q--h-TBoDQjFJ4?usp=sharing).


At this stage our model is trained only for VITON dataset and it gives best result for the same. We will train the model with different data set and update our repository in future.

## For input, the code is written in the Colab notebook. The genrated output is stored in folder 'our_t_results'inside the 'test' folder.
